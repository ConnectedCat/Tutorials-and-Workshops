    <h1>Serial data To and from ESP32 and ArduinoIDE</h1>
    <p>Since our misrocontroller connects to a computer via a USB cable - USB stands for Universal Serial Bus - we can send and receive data via a USB cable using ESP32 microcontroller. In this example we'll use <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HUZZAH32 board from Adafruit</a>. You can program those boards using different methods and languages, but we'll focus on using <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArduinoIDE</a>, as per Adafruit instructions. Before you begin you need to make sure your Arduino IDE is setup for use with the HUZZAH32 boards, for more details and step-by-step instrucitons visit <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/using-with-arduino-ide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HUZZAH32 page on the Adafruit learning portal.</a> You can use this guide for other boards as well with small deviations for board-specific operations.</p>

    <h3>Sending single data reading from Arduino IDE via serial</h3>
    <p>We will start by connecting a potentiometer to your ESP32. We'll use a breadboard with a plugged-in HUZZAH32 and connect a potentiometer to pin A2.</p>
    <img src="ESP32withPot.png" alt="Adafruit ESP32 plugged into a breadboard with a potentiometer connected to input A2" />
    <p>We will need initialize the serial connection in the <code>setup()</code> function with a specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baud</a> rate - the rate of data transmission. It's not very important what that rate is as long as we are sending and recieving data on the same rate. Then we'll read the analog value coming from the A2 pin and send it off to the serial port on our computer via USB. We'll be using <code>println()</code> function because it will add a new line character after each printed statement, resulting in each print being on a separate line. We'll also a delay of 100 milliseconds to limit the number of prints to 10 times per seconds and avoid being overwhelemed by the flurry of information.</p>
    <code>
<pre>void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
    
void loop() {
    Serial.println(analogRead(A2));
    delay(100);
} </pre>
    </code>
    <p>Once you verify and upload this code to your ESP32 you should be able to open the Serail Monitor and see the numbers change from 0 to 4095 as you move your potentiometer back and forth.</p>

    <h3>Sending multiple data readings from ArduinoIDE via serial</h3>
    <p>We can send multipe values from our microcontroller concurrently, provided we have a consistent encoding schema for them. So far we've sent one numerical value and use an end-of-line (aka new line) character <code>â®‘</code> to identify the end of transmission - which would also allow us to separate one value from the next. This time we'll read from 3 sensors - a potentiometer, a button and a photoresistor - and send those 3 values at once. We'll use the following encoding: The position of the value will tell us which sensor it is from. The value in the first position will be from the potentiometer, the second - from the button, and the third - from the photoresistor. We'll separate those values with a predetermined character. It's not important which character that is, but a <code>,</code> is a convention, so we'll use that. Finally, we'll use end-of-line character to specify the end of transmission and the characters that come after it will count as the next reading of the three sensors.</p>
    <p>The breadboard will be configured as follows:</p>
    <img src="ESP32withPotButtonPhoto.png" alt="Adafruit ESP32 plugged into a breadboard with a potentiometer, a button and a photoresistor connected." />
    <p>In our code we'll use <code>print()</code> functions to add values to a single transmission, but at the end of it we'll use <code>println()</code> to add the end-of-line character and signify the end of the current transmission and the beginning of the new one.</p>
    <code>
<pre>#define POTENTIOMETER A2
#define BUTTON 13
#define PHOTORESISTOR A3

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.print(analogRead(POTENTIOMETER));
    Serial.print(',');
    Serial.print(digitalRead(BUTTON));
    Serial.print(',');
    Serial.println(analogRead(PHOTORESISTOR));
    delay(100);
}
</pre>
    </code>
