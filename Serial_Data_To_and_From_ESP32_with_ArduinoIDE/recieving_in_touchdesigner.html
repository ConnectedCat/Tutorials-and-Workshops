    <h1>Receiving serial data in TouchDesigner</h1>

    <p>Just like we were able to receive the data from the serial port using the Serial Monitor built into ArduinoIDE we can receive it with other application that have the capability. One important thing to remember is that only one application can be connected to a given serial port at a time. This means that if you are viewing the data with the Serial Monitor you won't be able to recieve it in, for example, Processing. You will need to close one connection to enable another.</p>
